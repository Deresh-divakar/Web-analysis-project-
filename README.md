# Web-analysis-project-
Web tracking application hosted as local using flask and python,html,css.It is pretty simple to understand.Or use ChatGPT
We use HTML,CSS for interface
Using python and importing libraries like pandas,matplotlib,os and flask
Flask is used to create an simple web application that is hosted locally 
We upload the data and then we get the visualization of that data 
There should be two columns date and visit
We need to clean the dataset to remove null values
Put all of the files in an same main folder,put the visualization and index in a new folder named templates inside the main folder
Like that put style.css file into a new folder named in the main folder static 
then create a folder named uploads in the main folder
the app.py file will be in the main folder without any subfolder
